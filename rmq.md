## Speaking

I am available as an outside consultant for digital arts and humanities research administration and pedagogy development, for individual departmental needs or for campus-wide programs. My role in establishing a digital-arts-and-humanities training pipeline is well suited to helping develop campus-wide digital-humanities faculty and graduate-student professional development programs, and my experience using digital methods as both a medieval historian and as an educational researcher root my DH consulting work in several academic domains.

In addition to more general DH consulting, I also offer workshops on a variety of tools and methods, with a particular tool focus on network analysis and a methods focus on attracting traditional researchers and teachers to digital methods using analog tools.

See below for a list of select invited presentations and workshops.
